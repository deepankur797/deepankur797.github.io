I'm a computer science graduate from [UPES](https://admission.upes.ac.in/portal/your-university-campus), Dehradun, having specialized in Telecom Informatics. I have worked across various MNC's for the past 3 years. I've built a solid understanding of cloud automation through the vRealize Suite (vRA & vRO). I've also dabbled around with Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes as part of my job requirements.

I consider myself to be fundamentally sound in the core subjects of computer science, which includes but is not restricted to Algorithms, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Data Structures, and Databases.

I created this site to share experience about my carrer. In case you found any issue with this site, feel free to open a PR on github.
